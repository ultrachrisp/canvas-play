#+TITLE: Adventures in canvas

Canvas is an often overlooked feature in HTML5. Granted, it has it's downsides but it also has its strengths. I used this project to up-skill myself in the HTML canvas tag.

This code still smells at the moment. Initially, I was going to attempt a more functional approach to writing particle systems in ES6. But after some more thought, I might use this project as an excuse to dive into clojurescript.
